CSS Positioning Exercise


This project folder contains a sample web page for the sci-fi movie "The Matrix".
Your task is to style this page in a logical way, using the-matrix.png as reference.
Use the external stylesheet I have provided for your project.  Also make sure to
use each CSS positioning scheme at least once (relative, fixed, absolute, and float).


You should be able to get almost all the information you need from 
the-matrix.png but below are a few additional hints:

1. Don't forget to Link your html page to the external stylesheet
2. Make sure to specify a font for the page (not just the default font)
3. The nav bar should NOT scroll with the page
4. The nav bar should appear "above" any other content
5. You will need to make sure the first paragraph after the quote/image
   DOES NOT wrap around the quote/image
